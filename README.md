# Django Channels based WebSocket GraphQL server with Graphene-like subscriptions

## Features

- WebSocket-based GraphQL server implemented on the Django Channels.
- Graphene-like subscriptions support.
- Operation order is guaranteed due to WebSocket usage.
- Subscription groups support based on the Django Channels groups.

## Requirements
- python>=3.6

## Quick start

The `channels_graphql_ws` module provides two classes: `Subscription`
and `GraphqlWsConsumer`. The `Subscription` class itself is a "creative"
copy of `Mutation` class from the Graphene
(`graphene/types/mutation.py`). The `GraphqlWsConsumer` is a Channels
WebSocket consumer which maintains WebSocket connection with the client.

Create GraphQL schema, e.g. using Graphene (note that subscription
definition syntax is close to the Graphene mutation definition):

```python
import channels_graphql_ws
import graphene

class MySubscription(channels_graphql_ws.Subscription):
    """Sample GraphQL subscription."""

    # Subscription payload.
    event = graphene.String()

    class Arguments:
        """That is how subscription arguments are defined."""
        arg1 = graphene.String()
        arg2 = graphene.String()

    def subscribe(self, info, arg1, arg2):
        """Called when user subscribes."""

        # Return the list of subscription group names.
        return ['group42']

    def publish(self, info, arg1, arg2):
        """Called to notify the client."""

        # Here `self` contains the `payload` from the `broadcast()`
        # invocation (see below).

        return MySubscription(event='Something has happened!')

class Query(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Root GraphQL query."""
    # Check Graphene docs to see how to define queries.
    pass

class Mutation(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Root GraphQL mutation."""
    # Check Graphene docs to see how to define mutations.
    pass

class Subscription(graphene.ObjectType):
    """Root GraphQL subscription."""
    my_subscription = MySubscription.Field()

my_schema = graphene.Schema(
    query=Query,
    mutation=Mutation,
    subscription=Subscription,
)
```

Make your own WebSocket consumer subclass and set the schema it serves:

```python
class MyGraphqlWsConsumer(channels_graphql_ws.GraphqlWsConsumer):
    """Channels WebSocket consumer which provides GraphQL API."""
    schema = my_schema
```

Setup Django Channels routing:

```python
application = channels.routing.ProtocolTypeRouter({
    'websocket': channels.routing.URLRouter([
        django.urls.path('graphql/', MyGraphqlWsConsumer),
    ])
})
```

Notify clients when some event happens:

```python
MySubscription.broadcast(
    # Subscription group to notify clients in.
    group='group42',
    # Dict delivered to the `publish` method as the `self` argument.
    payload={},
)
```

## Details

For details check the [source code](channels_graphql_ws/graphql_ws.py)
which is thoroughly commented. (The docstrings of the `Subscription`
class in especially useful.)

Since the WebSocket handling is based on the Django Channels and
subscriptions are implemented in the Graphene-like style it is
recommended to have a look the documentation of these great projects:

- [Django Channels](http://channels.readthedocs.io)
- [Graphene](http://graphene-python.org/)

The implemented WebSocket-based protocol was taken from the library
[subscription-transport-ws](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws)
which is used by the [Apollo GraphQL](https://github.com/apollographql).
Check the [protocol description](https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md)
for details.

## Alternatives

There is a [Tomas Ehrlich](https://gist.github.com/tricoder42)
GitHubGist [GraphQL Subscription with django-channels](https://gist.github.com/tricoder42/af3d0337c1b33d82c1b32d12bd0265ec)
which this implementation was initially based on.

There is a promising [GraphQL WS](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws)
library by the Graphene authors. In particular
[this pull request](https://github.com/graphql-python/graphql-ws/pull/9)
gives a hope that there will be native Graphene implementation of the
WebSocket transport with subscriptions one day.
